Quick test cases
1) On-time filing & payment (no penalties or interest)

fyMonth: March

taxYear: 2024 → FY end = 2024-03-31

filingDate: 2024-03-15

dueDate: 2024-06-30

paymentDate: 2024-06-30

outstanding: 1000
Expect: No penalty, no interest, total = outstanding.

2) Filing exactly on FY end (no penalty)

FY end = 2024-03-31

filingDate: 2024-03-31

dueDate: 2024-06-30, paymentDate: 2024-07-01, outstanding: 500
Expect: Filing on FY end => no late filing penalty; interest may apply if payment after due date.

3) Filing 1 day late (counts as 1 month late → lowest tier)

FY end = 2024-03-31

filingDate: 2024-04-01

dueDate: 2024-06-30, paymentDate: 2024-07-15, outstanding: 2000
Expect: monthsLate = 1 → Individual penalty ≈ €10 (default tier). Interest on late payment from due date to payment date.

4) Filing exactly at 7 months late (switch to 2nd tier)

FY end = 2024-03-31

filingDate: 2024-10-31

dueDate: 2024-06-30, paymentDate: 2024-11-15, outstanding: 1500
Expect: monthsLate = 7 → Individual penalty ≈ €50 (default). Interest applies.

5) Very long overdue (61+ months)

FY end = 2019-03-31

filingDate: 2024-04-30

dueDate: 2019-06-30, paymentDate: 2024-05-15, outstanding: 3000
Expect: monthsLate ≥ 61 → highest tier penalty (default Individual €500). Interest for many months; total large.

6) Payment before due date (invalid input)

Any FY (e.g., FY end 2024-03-31)

dueDate: 2024-06-30, paymentDate: 2024-06-01 (earlier)
Expect: Validation error: “Payment date must be on or after the due date.” — no calculation.

7) Payment equals due date (no interest)

dueDate: 2024-06-30, paymentDate: 2024-06-30, outstanding 1200
Expect: No interest charged (payment on due date). Penalty depends only on filing date.

8) Interest crossing many historic rate periods (multi-period interest)

dueDate: 2013-12-31

paymentDate: 2022-07-15

outstanding: 10000
Expect: Interest computed in segments across multiple rate periods (2009–2013 rate, 2014–2019 rate, 2020–2022 rate, and 2022-06-01+ rate where applicable). Good test to ensure the piecewise interest calculation works.

9) Edge: payment straddles the 2022-06-01 interest-rate boundary

dueDate: 2022-05-01

paymentDate: 2022-07-15

outstanding: 5000
Expect: Part of the delay falls before 2022-06-01 (0.33%/month) and part after (0.6%/month). You should see the calculation reflect both rates.

10) Filing date unreasonably early (validation: too-early filing)

FY end = 2024-03-31 → earliest allowed filing in default validation is 2022-03-31

filingDate: 2021-12-01
Expect: Validation error: “Filing date seems unreasonably early for this tax year.”

11) Negative outstanding amount (invalid)

outstanding: -100
Expect: Validation error: “Outstanding amount cannot be negative.”

12) Extremely large outstanding (invalid)

outstanding: 1000000000 (1 billion)
Expect: Validation error: “Outstanding amount is too large.”

13) Leap-year FY end (Feb 29)

fyMonth: February, taxYear: 2020 → FY end = 2020-02-29

filingDate: 2020-03-01 (one day later)

dueDate: 2020-05-31, paymentDate: 2020-06-15, outstanding: 800
Expect: Filing after 2020-02-29 counts as 1 month late (check monthsLate is computed correctly with leap day).

Quick checklist of what to observe when running each case

Does the component show validation errors where expected? (cases 6, 10, 11, 12)

Is monthsLate shown and does it match expectations for 1 day late, 7 months, 61+ months?

Does the penalty badge match the correct tier (e.g., 1 → €10, 7 → €50, 61+ → €500 by default)?

Is interest split correctly across different historic rate periods (cases 8 & 9)?

Does payment on due date correctly yield zero interest?

Are total and breakdown numbers sensible and human-readable?
